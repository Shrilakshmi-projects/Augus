# Augus
Augus AI is a desktop-based virtual assistant, built using Python and OpenAIâ€™s API. It responds to voice commands to perform tasks like opening apps, checking the weather, giving AI-based answers, and reading emails. I used SpeechRecognition, pyttsx3 for voice, and integrated GPT for intelligent responses.
